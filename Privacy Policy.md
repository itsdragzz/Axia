# Privacy Policy
By using Axia, you agree to the following privacy policy.

Axia collects user and guild IDS for our database, which we store until a user requests for the data to be deleted via the ',deletedata' command or they can email me via ecdragonzz@gmail.com
We collect data for our moderation command and utility commands. No one has access to our database, other then the owner's account which is protected with 2FA 
and a password consisting of over 20 characters. We use mongodb as our database and Heroku as our host provider. If you have any concerns about the bot please don't hesitate to dm me or email me. 

## Commands that use our database
Command | How to delete data  | How we store data
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
warn | remove warn or deletedata | when you warn a user, it stores the warn as a array
suggest | deletedata | stores the guild id and the channel id
report | deletedata | stores the guild id and the channel id 

Note: We reserve the right to change this without notifying our users.
This policy was last updated September 28th, 2020.
Thanks for using our discord bot, Axia
